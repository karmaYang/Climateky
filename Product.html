<h3>About Product - Climate Change</h3>
Climate change includes both human-induced global warming and its large-scale impacts on weather patterns. There have been previous periods of climate change, but the current changes are more rapid than any known events in Earth's history. The main cause is the emission of greenhouse gases, mostly carbon dioxide (CO2) and methane. Burning fossil fuels for energy use creates most of these emissions. Agriculture, steel making, cement production, and forest loss are also significant sources. Temperature rise is affected by climate feedbacks as well, such as the loss of sunlight-reflecting snow cover, and the release of carbon dioxide from drought-stricken forests. Collectively, these amplify global warming.
  Consuming non-renewable energy sources creates ozone depleting substance emanations that behave like a sweeping folded over the Earth, catching the sun's hotness and raising temperatures</p>
<!-- paragraph 2 -->
<p>Instances of ozone depleting substance discharges that are causing environmental change incorporate carbon dioxide and methane. These come from utilizing gas for driving a vehicle or coal for warming a structure, for instance. Clearing area and timberlands can likewise deliver carbon dioxide. Landfills for trash
  are a significant wellspring of methane outflows. Energy, industry, transport, structures, agribusiness and land use are among the primary producers. (Climate change - Wikipedia) </p>

<h2>Impacts of climate change</h2>
<p>Environmental change can influence our wellbeing, capacity to develop food lodging, security and work. A few of us are now more helpless against environment impacts, for example, individuals living in little island countries and other non-industrial nations. Conditions like ocean level
   ascent and salt water interruption have progressed to where entire networks have neded to move, and extended dry spells are putting individuals in danger of starvation. Later on, the quantity of "environment evacuees" is relied upon to rise.</p>

<h2>Factors affecting climate change</h2>
<p>Climate change is happening mainly due to us.Our Human activities releases excessive amounts of greenhouse gases into our atmosphere which warms the temperstire of the globe and therefore making u ssuffer.</p>

<p>The main cause of climate change are MAINLY HUMAN CAUSE. The activities includes as follow:<p>

  <li> Growth in Industrilation</li>
  <li> Incresase use of fossil fuels</li>
  <li> Intensive Agriculture 3</li>
  <li> Deforestation</li>
