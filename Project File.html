       <h3>Climate change.</h3>
<p> Climate change is a long-term shift in global or regional climate patterns.
   Often climate change refers specifically to the rise in global temperatures
    from the mid-20th century to present.slo Environmental change alludes to
    long haul shifts in temperatures and climate designs. These movements might
     be normal, for example, through varieties in the sun based cycle. In any
     case, since the 1800s, human exercises have been the primary driver of
     environmental change, principally because of consuming petroleum products
      like coal, oil and gas.
<br>
Consuming non-renewable energy sources creates ozone depleting substance
emanations that behave like a sweeping folded over the Earth, catching the
 sun's hotness and raising temperatures.

Instances of ozone depleting substance discharges that are causing environmental
 change incorporate carbon dioxide and methane. These come from utilizing gas
 for driving a vehicle or coal for warming a structure, for instance. Clearing
  area and timberlands can likewise deliver carbon dioxide. Landfills for trash
  are a significant wellspring of methane outflows. Energy, industry, transport,
   structures, agribusiness and land use are among the primary producers.
    <br>
    OR
    The rise in the temperatue of the earth
     is called Global Warming and it is one of the factrs contributing to Climate
     change.</p>

<h4>Impacts of climate change</h4>
<p>Environmental change can influence our wellbeing, capacity to develop food
   lodging, security and work. A few of us are now more helpless against
   environment impacts, for example, individuals living in little island
   countries and other non-industrial nations. Conditions like ocean level
   ascent and saltwater interruption have progressed to where entire networks
   have needed to move, and extended dry spells are putting individuals in
   danger of starvation. Later on, the quantity of "environment evacuees" is
   relied upon to rise.</p>

   <h3>2.Mission Statement</h3>
   <p> Our mission is to help people understandatd about the Climate change in
     a simple way. It here by help people to take actions to help prevent
     cllimate chage in every small possible way. The climate change is
     brought by us human and we must correct our wrong doings and its possible.
      therrfore this webstoie help usnderstand climate change better and following
      some of the methods mentioned will help us all lilve in better community.</p>

<h3>3.About</h3>
I am Karma Yangden from Bhutan. Since i am from the mountainous country we have the
privilage enjoy/breathe fresh air and clean water and also we are carbon negative country.
but as we are facing the climate change effect we too are affected by the climate the side effects of climate change.
so inorder to spread awareness to the people so as to prevent further effeccts of the climate change
i came up with this website. i hope we can together protect our mother nature and live in better clean environment.
